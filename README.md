# Bootstrap-Portfolio

## Description

The aim of this project is to set up a Portfolio page using Bootstrap to showcase my work; viewable on both desktop and mobile devices.

The website can be viewed [here](https://duouk2000.github.io/Bootstrap-Portfolio/)

## Installation

NA

## Usage

The website first contains a nav bar menu from which you can select where on the website you wish to quickly jump to. It also contains my resume. Scroll down to see my name, photograph and work selection. Below that is a list of skills I have so far learnt as well as an 'About Me' section and contact information links. 

My Twitter and Spotify are in the footer along with a button that takes you to the top of the page. 

All links and the button have a hover effect on them that turns the text aqua coloured when the mouse hovers over it. The button also has a pink box-shadow effect that appears when the mouse hovers over it.
